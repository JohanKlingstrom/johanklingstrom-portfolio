# Portfolio, Johan Klingström 2022
Hosted live at [https://johanklingstrom.netlify.app](https://johanklingstrom.netlify.app).

## About the project
This is my first web development portfolio, and I wanted to focus on displaying a few things and technologies that I'm currently interested in relating to front end. Three.js had been a learning goal for me since I started my front end developer education at Hyper Island last autumn, so bringing in that (slightly) interactive visual element was a milestone for me in this project. I also took the time to practice React with this one, focusing on making a simplistic UI layout with a few higher order components.
